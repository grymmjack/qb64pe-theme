# qb64pe-theme

## A modern take on a retro feel.

This theme is loosely inspired by the QBasic and QuickBasic 4.5 IDEs but updated for [QB64PE](https://www.qb64phoenix.com/), and the [QB64PE Language extension](https://github.com/grymmjack/qb64pe-vscode/blob/main/qb64pe-0.10.0.vsix) (WIP not yet published manual install required).

This theme uses some colors from [MS-DOS Editor Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ionicabizau.ms-dos-editor-theme) by [Ionică Bizău](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/ionicabizau)

## NOTE

This is the first theme, but I plan to create more that will loosely adhere to the [QB64PE](https://www.qb64phoenix.com/) IDE color schemes that come by default with [QB64PE](https://www.qb64phoenix.com/).
